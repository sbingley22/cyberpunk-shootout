A simple gallery shooter / typing shooter made using just basic react. Makes heavy use of useEffect, useState, useRef, and setTimeout to make the game loop. In future iteractions I will use more useRef and less useState to avoid stale state in setTimeout.

David Martinez:
Click and hold to shoot at enemies. Enemies flash when they are about to hit you, take cover then.

Lucy Kushinada:
Hold space to see kill words. Type them whilst behind cover then press spacebar to eliminate enemy.
